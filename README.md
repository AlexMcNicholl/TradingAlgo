**Trading Algorithm**

**OBJECTIVES **

**Step-by-Step Recommended Approach**

Phase 1: Build and Validate the Algorithm

Develop the Core Model:
Focus on cointegration, spread modeling, and z-score calculation.
Ensure entry and exit signals are based on sound statistical principles.
Include risk management mechanisms (e.g., stop-loss, position sizing).

Backtest Thoroughly:
Test the strategy across multiple timeframes and market conditions.
Incorporate realistic assumptions:
Transaction costs.
Slippage and execution delays.
Use metrics like Sharpe Ratio, Sortino Ratio, drawdown, and profit factor to evaluate performance.

Simulate Paper Trading:
Use historical replay or a live data simulation (with no actual trade execution).
Track the strategy in real time to verify it performs similarly to backtesting results.
Optimize and Debug:

Adjust entry/exit thresholds, lookback periods, and risk management parameters.
Fix any issues in the algorithm, such as sensitivity to certain market conditions.


Phase 2: Transition to Live Trading


Set Up the Trading Infrastructure:
Integrate with broker APIs (like Interactive Brokers) using libraries like ib_insync.
Implement robust execution logic:
Avoid over-trading.
Use limit orders to reduce slippage.
Log all trades, decisions, and signals for analysis.

Run Parallel Paper Trading:
While testing live integration, continue paper trading to validate consistency.
Compare live signal generation with historical simulations.


Implement Risk Controls:

Add safeguards, such as:
Daily loss limits.
Position limits per trade and portfolio-wide.
Use a circuit breaker to pause trading during extreme volatility.
Deploy Incrementally:

Start with small trade sizes or a limited amount of capital.
Gradually increase exposure as confidence in the system grows.
